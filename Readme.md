## Project Motivation
With nearly 60,000 responses fielded from over 170 countries and dependent territories, our 2017 Annual Developer Survey examines all aspects of the developer experience from career satisfaction and job search to education and opinions on open source software.

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:
1. After partition dataset into k clusters, what about developer distribution?
2. Which features are more important for CareerSatisfactionï¼Ÿ(top 3)
3. These features are linear correlation or non-linear correlation?

# Developer Survey Analysis

* Clean up survey dataset and exact features
* Convert categorical value to numerical value
* Display all developers distribution based on those features (using K-Mean)
* Analysis feature importances between "career satisfication" feature and other selected features
* Research Relationship(Linear corelation or Non-Linear corelation) between "career satisfication" feature and other selected features
